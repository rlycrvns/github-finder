# Github Finder React App Project

## Deployed via Netlify to https://githubfinder-rlycrvns.netlify.app/

### This project was made by following along with Brad Traversy's Udemy course React [React Front to Back 2019](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/)

It runs a search on Github users, returning profile information along with the user's 5 most recent repos

The initial build of the project is done using Class Components, a refactor is then done to implement hooks, and finally a third refactor is done to implement the Context API
